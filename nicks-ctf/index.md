## General Information

Hosted By: [CU Cyber](https://cucyber.net)

Created By: [Nick Bulischeck](https://nbulischeck.io)

## Rules

1. No sharing of flags. Helping point someone in the right direction is encouraged as the entire point of a CTF is to learn, but simply handing someone a solution won't benefit them.
2. No attacking the scoreboard. 
3. No brute forcing. All challenges can be done without DDoSing or bruteforcing flags. If there is any need to run a binary a million times, it will work on your own system. 
4. No DoSing. If you intentionally hold the challenges of the platform down, you will be banned.
